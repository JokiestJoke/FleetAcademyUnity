About the game:

	So what will Fleet Academy be? Fleet Academy currently is a Unity built game programmed moslty in C#. This game is 2.5D, which means its a mix of 3d elements and 2D 'billboarded' sprites reminiscent of Nintendos "Paper Mario".
Fleet Academy will offer turn based fleet combat, and is heavily influenced by Pokemon, Starship Troopers, Warhammer 40k and many other JRPG elements. The player will take part in a story driven adventure that will explore the future in a distant galaxy. 
In this story, humanity's first contact with another intelligent form of life happens on the the very planet they inhabit. Instead of this lifeform being another organic, they are artificially constructed automatons created by the humans. While originally created 
as mere droid with basic functions, these artifical beings evolved to be considered truly intelligent. However, this discovery was not a welcome one to their human creators and a great war leaves humanity at the brink of destruction. Capitols were in ruin,
infrastructure was leveled, and lives lost at an unprecedented level during a robotic uprising. The war only comes to an end with the mass exodus of the machine intelligences and the near destruction of humanity. Out of the ashes, a new human society emerges.
One where everyone serves in the "Fleet" in defense of humanity. Take control of a young cadet and join up with the Fleet! With a plethora of ships learn how to best defend humanity. Explore a story driven game
that explores choices, love, hate, jingoism, and redemption.


Whos developing the game and why?:

	Me! This project is a solo project and may take some time to hammer out a lot of the game functionality. However, progress has been swift and major game features have been added in short order. I expect I will 
reapproach some of my commited files if I believe I can make them better so please stay tuned to my github! Why am I making this game? Ever since I was a kid I have been facinated in video games. I wanted to try to explore
game development on a small scale. Not only that, but I am a recent graduate of Drexel University where I studied Computer Science and I am presently looking for a job as a junior developer. This project offers me the abillity
to continously practice my programming skills as well as hopefully show a potential employer what I am capable of. I bring a lot of passion into my work and the code I put into this project
culminates from all my schooling and personal research.
